# Practicing HTML / CSS / JS with a Calculator
credits : Youtube chanel "Web Dev Simplified"

## Working method :
I watched the video a couple of times trying to understand every single line of code Kyle implemented then I tried to do it by myself, always keeping in mind the process, the verification of how it should work (AKA testing), and trying not to do it by memory (that was the hardest part).

I also tried to commit as much as possible to get familiar with git commit.

Thanks WDS for the tutorial, it was really useful.
